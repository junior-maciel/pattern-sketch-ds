#Hello everyone! Welcome.

This is a study project for creating, organizing and sharing a sketch file structure that can serve as the basis for a Design System.

##Problem:
Designers and companies that for some reason cannot adopt image-based versioning software, need to adopt a versioning format and documentation of the evolution of their files.

##Goals
Create a versioning methodology and a communication process between teams of designers, using github, containing best practices for contributing, sharing and evolving the project.
